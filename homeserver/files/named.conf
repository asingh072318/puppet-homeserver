- If you are building an AUTHORITATIVE DNS server, do NOT enable recursion.
- If you are building a RECURSIVE (caching) DNS server, you need to enable 
  recursion. 
- If your recursive DNS server has a public IP address, you MUST enable access 
  control to limit queries to your legitimate users. Failing to do so will
  cause your server to become part of large scale DNS amplification 
  attacks. Implementing BCP38 within your network would greatly
  reduce such attack surface
